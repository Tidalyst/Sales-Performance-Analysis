# Sales-Performance-Analysis

**Project Overview**

As a data analyst at a mid-sized retail company. I've been provided with a dataset containing sales data and employee performance metrics. Your task is to perform a detailed analysis to provide insights into sales performance, employee efficiency, and overall trends.



**Tasks**

1. Calculate the total sales for each department.

2. Calculate the average sales per employee in each department.

3. Create a new column next to the Sales Target column and identify whether or not each employee met or exceeded their sales target.

4. Count how many employees in each department met or exceeded their sales targets.

5. Create a new column, “Bonus Amount,” where employees receive a 10% bonus of their sales amount if they are eligible for a bonus (Bonus Eligible = YES) and their sales amount meets or exceeds the target. Employees will only get a bonus is both conditions are met, if not the bonus amount would be zero.

6. Create a new column and calculate the number of years each employee has been with the company from their hire date to the current date.

7. Create a new column and categorize each sale by quarter. Then, create a summary report showing total sales per quarter, per department.
